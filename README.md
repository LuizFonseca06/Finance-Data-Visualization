For Viewing interactive plot.ly graphs that were supposed to show towards the end of the project, please go to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.

Once in the site paste the url of the jupyter notebook (.ipynb file of this repository) on the search bar!
